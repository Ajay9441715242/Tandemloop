Welcome to the Java Programs Collection! This repository contains four beginner-friendly Java programs that showcase basic programming concepts. Each program is unique and serves as a practical example of Java functionality.

  ## Programs Overview
  
##1. Program1: Calculator
A basic calculator program to perform arithmetic operations:

#Addition
#Subtraction
#Multiplication
#Division

##How it works:

Enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) when prompted.
The program calculates the result and displays it.
Division by zero is handled with a warning message.

##Example:
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the operator (+, -, *, /): /
Enter the second number: 2
Result: 5.0


##2. Program2: Odd Number Series Generator
This program generates a series of the first a odd numbers.

#How it works:

Input an integer a.
The program outputs the first a odd numbers in sequence.

#Example:
Enter an integer value (a): 5
Output: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9

##3. Program3: Adjusted Odd Number Series
This program outputs a series of odd numbers up to the largest odd number less than or equal to a.

##How it works:

Input an integer a.
If a is odd, it outputs all odd numbers up to a.
If a is even, it outputs all odd numbers up to the largest odd number less than a.

##Example:

Enter an integer value (a): 6
Output: 1, 3, 5


##4. Program4: Multiples Counter
This program counts how many numbers in a predefined array are divisible by integers from 1 to 9.

##How it works:

The predefined array is: [1, 2, 8, 9, 12, 46, 76, 82, 15, 20, 30].
The program calculates how many numbers in the array are divisible by 1, 2, 3, ..., 9.
Results are shown in a dictionary-like format.

##Example:
Output: {1=11, 2=8, 3=4, 4=4, 5=3, 6=2, 7=0, 8=1, 9=1}
